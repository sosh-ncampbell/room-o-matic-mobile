[CUSTOMIZE]: Adapt to your language conventions

**[LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC]** Examples:
- **Go**: PascalCase for exported, camelCase for unexported
- **Python**: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/interfaces
- **Java/C#**: PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for variables
- **Rust**: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for types

### File Organization Patterns

```text
Feature-based grouping within domain boundaries
Separation of concerns following chosen architecture
Test files co-located with source files
Configuration files in dedicated directory
Documentation alongside relevant code
```

### Code Quality Standards

```text
- Consistent formatting with language-specific tools
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation on all external inputs
- Proper logging with structured format
- Security-first approach (authentication, authorization, input sanitization)
- Performance considerations (caching, database optimization, etc.)
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

[CUSTOMIZE]: Adapt to your testing framework

### Testing Strategy

```text
- Unit Tests: Test individual components in isolation
- Integration Tests: Test component interactions
- End-to-End Tests: Test complete user workflows
- Performance Tests: Load and stress testing
- Security Tests: Vulnerability and penetration testing
```

### Test Patterns

```text
- Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Test data factories for consistent test data
- Mock external dependencies
- Table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Parallel test execution where appropriate
```

### Coverage Requirements

```text
- Unit Tests: [80%] minimum coverage for business logic
- Integration Tests: [60%] minimum coverage overall
- Critical Path: [100%] coverage for critical business functions
```

## üîí Security Requirements

[CUSTOMIZE]: Add domain-specific security requirements

### Security Standards

```text
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- Authentication and authorization on all endpoints
- Secrets management (environment variables, secret managers)
- TLS/HTTPS for all external communications
- Rate limiting on public APIs
- Comprehensive audit logging for security events
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
```

### Domain-Specific Security

```text
[Add requirements specific to your domain]
- PCI DSS compliance (for payment processing)
- HIPAA compliance (for healthcare)
- GDPR compliance (for EU data processing)
- SOX compliance (for financial reporting)
```

## ‚ö° Performance Guidelines

[CUSTOMIZE]: Add language and domain-specific performance patterns

### Performance Patterns

```text
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategies (Redis, in-memory, CDN)
- Asynchronous processing where appropriate
- Pagination for large datasets
- Query optimization and indexing
- Resource cleanup and memory management
- Performance monitoring and profiling
```

### Language-Specific Optimizations

```text
[Add language-specific performance patterns]
- Go: Goroutines, channels, sync package usage
- Python: AsyncIO, multiprocessing, caching decorators
- JavaScript: Event loop optimization, worker threads
- Java: JVM tuning, garbage collection optimization
- C#: Memory management, async/await patterns
```

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

```text
- main/master: Production-ready code
- develop: Integration branch for features
- feature/[feature-name]: Feature development

- [Security Patterns](docs/security.md) - Security implementation guide
- [Testing Guide](docs/testing.md) - Testing strategies and patterns
- [Performance Guide](docs/performance.md) - Optimization techniques
```

### Context-Aware Usage

```text
For [SPECIFIC_TASK] implementation:
1. Apply basic patterns from these instructions
2. Reference [SPECIFIC_DOC] for advanced patterns:
   - Section X: [Specific advanced pattern]
   - Section Y: [Complex implementation details]
   - Section Z: [Edge cases and solutions]
```

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Optimization

- Ask for test generation alongside implementation
- Request security considerations for external-facing code
- Include performance considerations for data processing
- Validate generated code against project patterns
```

### Persona-Based Development Integration

```text
When using AI assistance, consider these specialized contexts:
