## üîó MCP Memory System (`mcp-memory.json`)

**Purpose**: Persistent knowledge graph that remembers information across chat sessions.

### How It Works

The MCP memory server automatically:
- **Remembers** people, projects, preferences from conversations
- **Connects** related information through relationships
- **Persists** knowledge across VS Code sessions
- **Searches** stored information for context

### Structure

MCP memory uses a knowledge graph format:

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "John_Smith",
      "entityType": "person",
      "observations": ["Prefers TypeScript over JavaScript", "Works on frontend team"]
    }
  ],
  "relations": [
    {
      "from": "John_Smith",
      "to": "Frontend_Team",
      "relationType": "works_on"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Usage Examples

The MCP memory system will automatically learn and remember:

- **Team Members**: Names, roles, preferences, working patterns
- **Project Details**: Architecture decisions, technology choices, constraints
- **Coding Patterns**: Preferred styles, naming conventions, architectural patterns
- **Business Context**: Domain knowledge, requirements, user feedback

### Configuration

The MCP server is configured in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_FILE_PATH": "/Users/nickcampbell/Projects/copilot-goat/.vscode/mcp-memory.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Customize Template Memory

1. Open `.vscode/memory.json`
2. Follow the customization instructions above
3. Save the file
4. The AI will use this context in all interactions

### 2. Enable MCP Memory

1. The MCP server is already configured in `.vscode/mcp.json`
2. VS Code will automatically start the memory server
3. Begin chatting - the AI will start building knowledge over time

### 3. Verify Setup

Test both systems:

```
// Test Template Memory
"What type of project am I working on?"
// Should reference your customized project type

// Test MCP Memory
"Remember that I prefer using clean architecture patterns"
// Will be stored in the knowledge graph for future sessions
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Template Memory Issues

- **AI not using context**: Verify `.vscode/memory.json` is valid JSON
- **Outdated information**: Update the relevant section in `memory.json`
- **Wrong suggestions**: Adjust `contextPreferences` and `aiOptimizations`

### MCP Memory Issues

- **Memory not persisting**: Check VS Code MCP extension is installed and enabled
- **Server not starting**: Verify NPX is available: `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory --help`
- **Path issues**: The MCP server may create its memory file in the default location rather than custom path
- **Storage issues**: Check that the VS Code workspace has write permissions
- **Testing setup**: Use the MCP memory tools to create initial entities and verify functionality

### MCP Memory Server Testing

To verify your MCP memory setup is working:

1. **Check server status**: Look for MCP memory server in VS Code's MCP extension status
2. **Test creation**: Try creating a simple entity to test the connection
3. **Verify storage**: Check if memory data persists between sessions
4. **Path verification**: The server may store data in its default location initially

## üìö Advanced Usage

### Template Memory for Multiple Projects

Create project-specific templates:

```bash
# Copy base template
cp .vscode/memory.json .vscode/memory-api.json
cp .vscode/memory.json .vscode/memory-frontend.json

# Customize each for different project types
# Reference them in your project documentation
```

### MCP Memory Management

Use MCP tools to manage stored knowledge:
- Search stored information: Use search functionality
- Clean up outdated info: Remove old entities/relations
- Export knowledge: Backup your knowledge graph

### Integration with CI/CD

Add memory validation to your pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Validate Template Memory
  run: |
    jq empty .vscode/memory.json # Validate JSON syntax
    # Add custom validation scripts
```

**Both memory systems work together to provide the most context-aware AI assistance possible!**
