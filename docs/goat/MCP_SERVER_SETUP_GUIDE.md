# üîå MCP Server Setup Guide

This guide helps you configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enhance your AI-assisted development experience with the Ultimate GitHub Copilot Template.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Basic MCP Configuration

The template includes a minimal MCP configuration in `.vscode/mcp.json`. All servers are commented out by default for security and performance reasons.

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root (add it to `.gitignore`):

```bash
# GitHub Integration
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token_here

# Database Integration (if using PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name

# Web Search Integration (if using Brave Search)
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key_here

# Debug Mode (optional)
DEBUG=mcp:*
```
