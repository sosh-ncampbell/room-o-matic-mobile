# ü¶á Chiroptera Overlay Interface Summary

## Overview

The **Chiroptera Overlay** is the visual interface for Room-O-Matic Mobile's bio-inspired echolocation technology. Named after the scientific order of bats (Chiroptera), this interface transforms ultrasonic audio measurements into an intuitive, real-time visual experience with a **modern professional aesthetic**.

## Key Visual Elements

### üéØ Core Interface Components

1. **Camera Viewfinder Background**
   - Live camera feed of the room environment
   - Slightly dimmed to enhance overlay visibility
   - Maintains natural color accuracy for spatial reference

2. **Modern Professional Crosshair**
   - Central precision measurement reticle with clean geometry
   - Subtle expanding rings during active scanning
   - Color-coded signal quality feedback (charcoal/blue/earth tones)

3. **Contemporary Measurement Visualization**
   - Clean geometric patterns emanating from crosshair during scan
   - Professional equipment visualization representing LiDAR/ToF/Audio fusion
   - Echo return indicators with modern material design elements

4. **Professional Distance Display**
   - Large, prominent distance reading (e.g., "2.47m") in Inter/SF Pro fonts
   - Accuracy indicator (¬±2cm typical) with contemporary styling
   - Real-time confidence percentage with modern progress indicators

### üè¢ Modern Professional Design Elements
