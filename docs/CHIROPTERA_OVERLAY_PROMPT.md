# ChatGPT Prompt: Render Chiroptera Technology Overlay Interface

## Context & Technology Overview

Create a detailed visual representation of the **Chiroptera Technology Overlay** for the Room-O-Matic Mobile app. Chiroptera is a bio-inspired echolocation technology named after bats (Order: Chiroptera) that uses ultrasonic audio signals (18-22kHz) for precise room measurement.

## Technical Foundation

**Technology Stack:**
- Flutter mobile app with camera overlay interface
- Bio-inspired echolocation using 18-22kHz ultrasonic frequencies
- Real-time cross-correlation signal processing
- ±5cm accuracy for distances up to 10 meters
- Security-first mobile architecture with biometric authentication

**Visual Context:**
- Mobile camera viewfinder as base layer
- Real-time measurement overlay on top of camera feed
- **1940s/1950s retro business aesthetic** with professional office styling
- 60fps performance target for smooth AR-style overlay

## Interface Design Requirements

### Primary Visual Elements

1. **Camera Viewfinder Background**
   - Live camera feed showing room environment

   - Maintains natural color accuracy for user orientation

2. **Central Crosshair/Target**
   - **Professional surveyor-style reticle** in screen center
   - **Expanding measurement rings** during active ping (like vintage range-finders)
   - **Business-appropriate color coding** based on distance/signal quality:
     - **Primary Red (#B91C1C)**: Active measurement state
     - **Success Green (#10B981)**: Excellent signal (0-3m)
     - **Accent Gold (#D97706)**: Good signal (3-6m)
     - **Charcoal Gray (#374151)**: Weak signal (8-10m)3. **Chiroptera Echo Visualization**
   - **Vintage oscilloscope-style** concentric circles from crosshair
   - **Retro sound wave patterns** inspired by 1950s audio equipment
   - **Professional frequency display** (18-22kHz range) like office instruments
   - **Business-grade echo indicators** when surface detected

4. **Distance Measurement Display**
   - Large, prominent distance reading (e.g., "2.47m")
   - Accuracy indicator (±5cm typical)
   - Confidence percentage based on signal quality
   - Unit toggle (metric/imperial)

5. **Retro Business Design Elements**
   - **Art Deco geometric borders** inspired by 1940s office buildings
   - **Professional pulse animations** like vintage measuring equipment
   - **Chiroptera branding** with **stylized compass/surveyor motifs**
   - **Executive office aesthetic** with warm amber and deep red highlights

### Secondary Interface Elements

1. **Status Indicators**
   - Chiroptera session active indicator
   - Audio permission status
   - Microphone/speaker activity indicators
   - Battery optimization status

2. **Environmental Feedback**
   - Room acoustics visualization
   - Background noise levels
   - Surface material detection hints
   - Temperature compensation indicator

3. **Control Buttons**
   - Ping trigger button (large, accessible)
   - Measurement mode selector
   - Settings access
   - Session recording toggle

### Advanced Features Overlay

1. **Multi-Point Measurement**
   - Previous measurement points marked on overlay
   - Distance lines between points
   - Room dimension calculations
   - Corner detection assistance

2. **Real-Time Analytics**
   - Signal processing visualization
   - Cross-correlation graph
   - Echo delay timing display
   - Frequency spectrum analysis

## Visual Style Guidelines

### Color Scheme
- **Primary:** Business Red (#B91C1C) - matching Room-O-Matic branding
- **Accent:** Success Green (#10B981) for excellent measurements
- **Professional:** Accent Gold (#D97706) for active indicators
- **Executive:** Charcoal Gray (#374151) for backgrounds
- **Surface:** Paper White (#FAFAFA) for data displays

### Typography
- **Primary Font:** **RobotoMono** (professional monospace for measurements)
- **Secondary Font:** Clean geometric sans-serif (for UI elements)
- **Business Hierarchy:** **Large (32sp)** for distance, **Medium (18sp)** for labels, **Small (14sp)** for details
- **Executive Style:** Letter-spacing and professional formatting

### Animation Principles
- **Pulse Animation:** 1-2 second duration for echo visualization
- **Smooth Transitions:** 300ms easing for value updates
- **Subtle Feedback:** Gentle haptic feedback simulation
- **Real-time Updates:** 60fps smooth data updates
