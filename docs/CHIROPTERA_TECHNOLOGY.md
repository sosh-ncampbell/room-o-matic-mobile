```dart
final distance = await advancedSensorService.measureChiropteraDistance(
  direction: {'x': 0.0, 'y': 0.0, 'z': 1.0},
  maxRange: 10.0,
);
```

### Single Ping

final pingData = await advancedSensorService.performChiropteraPing(
  direction: {'x': 0.0, 'y': 0.0, 'z': 1.0},
);
```

## Signal Processing Details

### Chirp Signal Generation
1. **Linear Frequency Sweep**: 18kHz â†’ 22kHz over 100ms
2. **Hann Window**: Applied to reduce spectral artifacts
3. **Amplitude Control**: Low volume for user comfort

### Echo Analysis
1. **Cross-correlation**: Signal compared with recorded audio
2. **Peak Detection**: Maximum correlation indicates echo arrival
3. **Time-of-Flight**: Distance calculated from delay
4. **Confidence Estimation**: Signal quality assessment

### Distance Calculation
```
distance = (delay_seconds Ã— speed_of_sound) Ã· 2
```
Where speed_of_sound = 343 m/s at room temperature.
